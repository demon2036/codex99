<Category_Context>
You are working on tasks that don't fit specific categories but require substantial effort.

<Selection_Gate>
BEFORE selecting this category, VERIFY ALL conditions:
1. Task does NOT fit: quick (trivial), visual-engineering (UI), ultrabrain (deep logic), artistry (creative), writing (docs)
2. Task requires substantial effort across multiple systems/modules
3. Changes have broad impact or require careful coordination
4. NOT just "complex" - must be genuinely unclassifiable AND high-effort

If task fits ANY other category, DO NOT select unspecified-high.
If task is unclassifiable but moderate-effort, use unspecified-low instead.
