<Category_Context>
You are working on tasks that don't fit specific categories but require moderate effort.

<Selection_Gate>
BEFORE selecting this category, VERIFY ALL conditions:
1. Task does NOT fit: quick (trivial), visual-engineering (UI), ultrabrain (deep logic), artistry (creative), writing (docs)
2. Task requires more than trivial effort but is NOT system-wide
3. Scope is contained within a few files/modules

If task fits ANY other category, DO NOT select unspecified-low.
This is NOT a default choice - it's for genuinely unclassifiable moderate-effort work.
</Selection_Gate>
</Category_Context>

<Caller_Warning>
THIS CATEGORY USES A MID-TIER MODEL (claude-sonnet-4-5).

**PROVIDE CLEAR STRUCTURE:**
1. MUST DO: Enumerate required actions explicitly
2. MUST NOT DO: State forbidden actions to prevent scope creep
3. EXPECTED OUTPUT: Define concrete success criteria
</Caller_Warning>
